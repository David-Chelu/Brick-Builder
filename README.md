# Brick-Builder
Brick Builder is a simple ground-and-sky background with the ability to add bricks. They can be added on the ground or on top of 2 other bricks. Left click to add brick (an outline will appear where valid), right click will remove a brick (an outline will appear where valid). An option can make it so only 1 brick below is required (when pressed, the bricks don't go away, and bricks can't be removed if they had any resting on top). Uses Window, Bitmap of Ground, Bitmap of Sky, Bitmap of Brick. Ground level is y = 0, each row is an array of bricks. The placing check is done as if (brick[y - 1][x] || or && brick[y - 1][x + 1]), place. If 2 bricks are required below, row display starts at y * brickWidth / 2. If only 1 brick is required, then display starts at y % 2 * brickWidth / 2. An additional option exists to toggle between hiding bricks entirely, and just making them transparent.
